IN CASE YOU RECEIVE BUILT ERRORS - .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.0 dlls
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In case you receive build errors or exceptions, you are most likely using
.NET 3.5 instead of 4.0. This setting can be viewed in:
  Player Settings -> Configuration -> Scripting Runtime Version
If you are using .NET 3.5 and don't want to switch to 4.0, please unzip the
package '2DColliderGen_Runtime_NET3.5.zip' in this directory, it will replace
the 2DColliderGen_Runtime.dll (which is built for .NET 4.0) with the respective
.NET 3.5 version.
